# Opencv Kalman Tracking
Use Kalman Filter tracking a single fish
### Getting Started

## Deployment
* [Opencv 3.1](https://opencv.org/opencv-3-1.html)

<p>This program using HUE to measure the position of the fish.</p>
<p>The green rectangle identifies the bounding box of the fish detected during the measure step.</p>
<p>The red rectangle shows the “estimated state” of the fish, the result of the prediction step of the Kalman Filter.</p>
