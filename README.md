# Opencv Kalman Tracking
Use kalman filter to track a fish underwater
### Getting Started
These programs utilize hue to measure the position of the fish and track it right away.
### Running the tests
The green rectangle identifies the bounding box of the fish detected during the measure step. The red rectangle shows the estimated state of the fish which is the result of the prediction step of the kalman filter.
