# Opencv Kalman Tracking
<<<<<<< HEAD

A case which use kalman filter to track a fish in underwater

![Stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg "The Stormtroopocat")


## Getting Started

[Download Opencv](https://opencv.org/downloads.html)

These programs utilize hue to measure the position of the fish and track it right away.

## Running the tests

There have 3 interesting rectangles
- The **green** one identifies the bounding box which detecte the fish during each step. 
- The **red** one shows the result of the prediction via **Kalman Filter** algorithm

## Requipment

- [Opencv >= 3.1](https://opencv.org/opencv-3-1.html) object detection tool
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) IDE u need to install 


=======
Use kalman filter to track a fish underwater
### Getting Started
These programs utilize hue to measure the position of the fish and track it right away.
### Running the tests
The green rectangle identifies the bounding box of the fish detected during the measure step. The red rectangle shows the estimated state of the fish which is the result of the prediction step of the kalman filter.
